# Predicting Malignant or Benign Breast Cancer Tumors.
This project was done as the Final Project Jan 2022 for the LightHouse Labs Data Science Bootcamp. 

## Introduction and Motive 
It is estimated that 1 in 8 women in Canada will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. 
As a method of risk prevention and screening is to use mammography to visualize if a tumor is present. Breast cancer is often associated with a development of a tumor, which can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). With dimensions of these tumors taken from mammograms or physical inspection, a machine learning model can be trained to help identify whether a tumor is likely cancerous or not. 

This implementation of machine learning could help physicians and pathologists in the field by filtering through mammogram results and determining if a given tumor is of concern based on its dimensions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Here, we visualize the number of cases we have and what the implications of the features are. 

This process gives us and idea of what margins we are working with, and based on domain knowledge, what measurements of tumor dimensions are more likely cancerous. 

## Feature Engineering:
There are many other features that would be interesting to incorporate, such as the presence of family history, the number of normal nucleoli, etc. However, due to the prepared features determined by the authors of the dataset, the features here are already determined without other information given about the individuals.

Thus, feature engineering will involve the removal or combination of given features in the data.
