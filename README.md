# Predicting Malignant or Benign Breast Cancer Tumors.
This project was done as the Final Project Jan 2022 for the LightHouse Labs Data Science Bootcamp. 

## Introduction and Motive 
It is estimated that 1 in 8 women in Canada will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. 
As a method of risk prevention and screening is to use mammography to visualize if a tumor is present. Breast cancer is often associated with a development of a tumor, which can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). With dimensions of these tumors taken from mammograms or physical inspection, a machine learning model can be trained to help identify whether a tumor is likely cancerous or not. 

This implementation of machine learning could help physicians and experts in the field by filtering through mammogram results and determining if a given tumor is of concern based on its dimensions.
