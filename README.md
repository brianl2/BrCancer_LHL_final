# Clustering Viruses based on Genome information - LightHouse Labs Data Science 
Final Project Jan 2022

In Genomics, homologous sequence alignment through comparisons of two genomes can measure the phylogenetic distance between organisms.
The more distantly related two organisms are, the less sequence similarity or shared genomic features will be detected between them.
Although this is specific to Eukaryotes, viruses may have a different measurement of similarity. 

Using Hierachical Clustering of Virus genomic features and a metric to measure similarity (based on taxonomy or based on which organism they infect) 

With the COVID-19 Pandemic permanently embedded into our daily lives, everyone has heard of the term virus. Viruses are submicroscopic infective agents that spread disease through the infection of live cells. Different Viruses exist to infect various organisms, from bacteria, invertebrate and humans etc. Virus similarity can be measured by ___ and with unsupervised learning and clustering of this measure and other features, the goal is to identify similar viruses (in the way they infect or phylogenetically)
